#Current Build

The latest build of OpenSOC-Streaming is 0.6BETA.  We are still in the process of merging/porting additional
features from our production code base into this open source release.  This release will be followed by
a number of additional beta releases until the port is complete.  We will also work on getting additional 
documentation and user/developer guides to the community as soon as we can.  At this time we offer no support
for the beta software, but will try to respond to requests as promptly as we can.
